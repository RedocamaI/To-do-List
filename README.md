# To-do-List
It is implemented in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and can be used daily to keep track of your TODOs.

## Description
Being productive each day plays a vital role in our success. This To-do-List designed to help you with
your productivity. Its interactive interface will alert you to complete your tasks listed there.
  ### Why I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build this project?
   * Learn these technologies while using them in a project.
   * Prepare for the final project of Cs50's Introduction to Computer Science.
   * Grab a good hold over Javascript.
  ### Challenges faced
   * The basic layout of the project was not working as expected. 
        The container was overflowing the body, in Html leading to unwanted horizontal scroll.
   * Good logic was required to include the feature of add and delete items in the list. 
     It also helped me know more about **_Javascript_**.
   * Maintain the correctness of the code, as it was getting larger.
  ### Features
  * You can add Title, Description, and due date of the task in your TODOs. 
  * TODOs with past due dates **Cannot** be added.
  * A Calendar is present to help you with the due date.
  * There can be **No Task** without any *title*, *description*, and *due date*.
  * A window contains *Description* and *Delete* option for a task, which pops up when clicked on it. Making it easier for the user to read the description for each task.
