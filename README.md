# Description
Do you often feel drained of, especially in the mid-day? Do you find yourself missing deadlines? Or do you forget something important, so that people have to chase you to get work done?

If this is what you feel like, most often, then all of these are the symptoms of NOT having a To-do List.
This To-do list is developed to wipe out those symptoms. Its interactive interface will alert you for approaching dues, sort, and even prioritize your tasks, as you add them along with the due date.

  * TODOs with past due dates **Cannot** be added.
  * A Calendar is present to help you with the due date.
  * There can be **No Task** without *title*, and *due date*.
  * A window contains *Description* and *Delete* option for a task, which pops up when clicked on it. Making it easier for the user to read the description for each task.
