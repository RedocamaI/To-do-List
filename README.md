## Description
Being productive each day plays a vital role in our success. This To-do-List designed to help you with
your productivity. Its interactive interface will alert you to complete your tasks listed there. The porpose of this project is to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This would also help me in the final project of  [CS50](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home)'s  Introduction to Computer Science.
Designing the *basic layout* of the to-do list was **not** an easy task. I learnt how to apply *logic* and give **life** to my code, also as the code was bulky, it was getting even more challenging to keep track of previous steps, as well making progress. This is my first project and I learnt a lot on how to maintain it alongside develop it. But, this is **Not** the **End of the Story**, I'll keep on adding many features that will make it more userfriendly.

  ### Features
  * You can add Title, Description, and due date of the task in your TODOs. 
  * TODOs with past due dates **Cannot** be added.
  * A Calendar is present to help you with the due date.
  * There can be **No Task** without *title*, and *due date*.
  * A window contains *Description* and *Delete* option for a task, which pops up when clicked on it. Making it easier for the user to read the description for each task.
